# Project Overview

This project implements a multi-modal classification model that combines image data (processed by Swin Transformer) and structured data (processed by a custom embedding and attention-based fusion module). The model is designed for tasks where both visual and tabular data are available, such as disaster impact assessment, where images of affected areas and structured data (e.g., evacuation zones, building age, etc.) are used to predict outcomes.

# Key features:

Multi-Modal Fusion: Combines image features (from Swin Transformer) and structured data features (from FModel) using a weighted fusion strategy.

Focal Loss: Addresses class imbalance by focusing on hard-to-classify samples.

Attention Mechanism: Uses multi-head attention to capture interactions between structured features.

# Model Components:

FocalLoss

Overview

FocalLoss is a custom loss function that extends the cross-entropy loss to address class imbalance by down-weighting easy-to-classify samples and focusing on hard-to-classify ones.

# Parameters:

alpha (float, default: 1): Weighting factor to balance positive and negative samples.

gamma (float, default: 2): Focusing parameter to emphasize hard samples. Higher values increase focus on difficult samples.

logits (bool, default: False): Whether the input is raw logits. If True, applies F.cross_entropy directly; if False, applies softmax first.

reduce (bool, default: True): Whether to reduce the loss. If True, returns the mean loss; if False, returns per-sample losses.

# Inputs and Outputs
## Inputs:

inputs (Tensor): Model predictions, shape (batch_size, num_classes).

targets (Tensor): Ground truth labels, shape (batch_size,).

## Outputs:

If reduce=True: Scalar (mean Focal Loss).

If reduce=False: Tensor of shape (batch_size,) (per-sample Focal Loss).

# Forward Logic:

## Compute the base cross-entropy loss:

If logits=True, use F.cross_entropy(inputs, targets, reduction='none').

If logits=False, apply F.softmax(inputs, dim=1) first, then compute cross-entropy.

Compute the confidence score: pt = torch.exp(-BCE_loss).

Apply the Focal Loss formula: F_loss = alpha * (1-pt)**gamma * BCE_loss.

Reduce the loss if reduce=True (using torch.mean).

# Usage Scenario

Suitable for classification tasks with class imbalance, such as medical image classification or object detection.

## BasicModel

## Overview
BasicModel is a feature embedding and fusion module that processes multiple discrete features (e.g., Evacuation_Zone, YearBuilt) by embedding them into a high-dimensional space and applying multi-head attention for feature interaction.

## Parameters

chioce_matrix (list): Feature selection mask. A value of 1 includes the feature, 0 excludes it.

embedding_size (list, default: [6, 113, 38, 115, 124, 120, 14]): Vocabulary sizes for each feature.

num_heads (int, default: 5): Number of heads in the multi-head attention mechanism.

## Architecture

Embedding Layers: Seven nn.Embedding layers, each mapping a discrete feature to a 1000-dimensional vector.

Multi-Head Attention: A MultiHeadAttention module (model_dim=1000, num_heads=num_heads) to capture feature interactions.

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs:

Evacuation_Zone (Tensor): Evacuation zone, shape (batch_size,).

YearBuilt (Tensor): Year of construction, shape (batch_size,).

EstimatedValue_level (Tensor): Estimated value level, shape (batch_size,).

dist_track_line (Tensor): Distance to track line, shape (batch_size,).

dist_track_landfall (Tensor): Distance to landfall, shape (batch_size,).

wind_mean (Tensor): Mean wind speed, shape (batch_size,).

flood_mean (Tensor): Mean flood intensity, shape (batch_size,).

### Output:

e (Tensor): Fused feature vector, shape (batch_size, 1000).

### Forward Logic

Embed each feature using the corresponding embedding layer, resulting in seven tensors of shape (batch_size, 1000).

Concatenate the embeddings along the second dimension: torch.cat((e1, e2, ..., e7), dim=1), shape (batch_size, 7, 1000).

Select features based on chioce_matrix, resulting in shape (batch_size, num_selected_features, 1000).

Apply multi-head attention: e, _ = self.att1(a_e, a_e, a_e), shape (batch_size, num_selected_features, 1000).

Aggregate features by taking the mean along the second dimension: e = torch.mean(e, dim=1), shape (batch_size, 1000).

# Usage Scenario

Ideal for tasks requiring embedding and fusion of multiple discrete features with attention-based interaction.

## FModel

## Overview

FModel builds on BasicModel to perform feature fusion and classification for structured data.

## Parameters

embedding_size (list, default: [6, 113, 38, 115, 124, 120, 14]): Vocabulary sizes for each feature.

chioce_matrix (list, default: [1,1,1,1,0,1,0]): Feature selection mask.

num_classes (int, default: 3): Number of classes for classification.

num_heads (int, default: 5): Number of heads in the multi-head attention mechanism.

## Architecture

Embedding Module: Uses BasicModel for feature embedding and fusion.

Linear Layer: nn.Linear(1000, num_classes) for classification.

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs: Same as BasicModel.

### Output:

x (Tensor): Classification logits, shape (batch_size, num_classes).

### Forward Logic

Use BasicModel to embed and fuse the structured features: e = self.embedding(...), shape (batch_size, 1000).

Pass the fused features through the linear layer: x = self.linear(e), shape (batch_size, num_classes).

# Usage Scenario

Suitable for classification tasks involving structured data with multiple discrete features.

## MixModel

## Architecture

Swin Transformer: swin_s model for image feature extraction.

Feature Fusion Module: FModel for structured data processing.

Dropout: nn.Dropout(p=0.25) to prevent overfitting.

Linear Layer: nn.Linear(1000, num_classes) for classification.

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs:

img (Tensor): Image data, shape (batch_size, channels, height, width).

Structured data inputs (same as BasicModel).

### Output:

x (Tensor): Classification logits, shape (batch_size, num_classes).

## Forward Logic

Extract image features using Swin Transformer: x = self.swim(img), shape (batch_size, 1000).

Fuse structured features using FModel: e = self.embedding.embedding(...), shape (batch_size, 1000).

Perform weighted fusion: x = x * self.ratio + (1 - self.ratio) * e.

Apply dropout: x = self.dropout(x).

Classify using the linear layer: x = self.linear(x), shape (batch_size, num_classes).

# Usage Scenario

Input Data Requirements
Image Data
Shape: (batch_size, 3, 224, 224) (RGB images, 224x224 resolution).
Preprocessing:
Resize images to 224x224.
Normalize pixel values (e.g., using ImageNet mean and standard deviation).
Structured Data
Feature Ranges:
Evacuation_Zone: Integer in [0, 5].
YearBuilt: Integer in [0, 112].
EstimatedValue_level: Integer in [0, 37].
dist_track_line: Integer in [0, 114].
dist_track_landfall: Integer in [0, 123].
wind_mean: Integer in [0, 119].

Shape: Each feature should be a tensor of shape (batch_size,).
Notes and Considerations
Pretrained Weights:
Ensure the pretrain_path and pretrained_path point to valid files.
The Swin Transformer weights must match the swin_s architecture.
Class Imbalance:
Adjust alpha and gamma in FocalLoss to handle class imbalance.
Computational Resources:
The Swin Transformer and multi-head attention require significant GPU memory. Use a GPU for training and inference.
Feature Selection:
The chioce_matrix allows selective inclusion of features. Modify it based on your use case.
